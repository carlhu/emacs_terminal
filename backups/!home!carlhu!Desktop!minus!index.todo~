Is there an option or possibility to delete comments and messages?
I think that tabs were better than text links (like now).
Eg. after clicking “publishing” I must go with mouse almost half of the screen to reach the options.
You should correct “Lights Mode”, it should be “Lights off” and “Lights on”.
Also, “List mode” looks strange, no options apart from privacy…
In the “Linear mode” in dark color scheme the organize files window (top right) looks awful, very awful.
Just for me, the button sticking all the time in the right down corner would be perfect solution for toggling browsing mode and lights.

*** □ increase hspace between filename, etc.
*** □ Decrease size of icons (or remove them entirely)

*** □ Make it clear that the image is loading. For example, show the size of image, with a percentage (possibly faked since js doesn't offer percentage). Use a bigger loading animated hourglass. (big gifs take a long time and people can't tell it's actually working).
*** □ Disable up/down keyboard manipulating item select. Let those keys scroll the window.
*** □ Click on next item, you get the hover cursor instead of the regular cursor, even though you're not hovering over the selected item.

*** □ Remove blinking of the comments box on item change.
